/*
* Main.scss
*
*  ## NOTES
*
* - The main.scss file is only responsible for importing all used scss files. None 
*   of the other files import anything. 
*
* - Keep in mind that the order of the imports matters in some case. E.g. the 'themes/colors'
*   contains global variables, used in some of the components. So it needs get imported first.
*
* - All the CSS is based on border-sizing: border-box!
*
* - We are using BEM notation as a convention to name CSS classes for consistency.
*   (http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) 
*
* - We use Normalize.css to define all HTML5 defaults for older browsers!
*
* - We are using Bourbon to avoid to have to prefix everything with vendor prefixes. Bourbon
*   also provides some conventient mixins to make some things easier and more consistent
*   (position, user-select)
* 
* - Global variables are UPPERCASE! / Local variables are lowercase!
*  
* - Avoid the nesting feature of SCSS, because it's harder to uncludder
*   CSS classes later on. The reason is that the nesting affects the specificity of those
*   classes and pulling them out has very often not wanted side effects.
*
* - The only time we wanna use nesting for now are modefier classes in the BEM system,
*   which are indicated by a double hyphen (--). Also in very few cases where we use
*   tags to semantically structure the markup (e.g <strong>).
*
*
* - Tip: Trying to keep the CSS hierarchy very flat. That allows you later on to create
*             easy overwrites of the existing rules.
*
* - Tip: Naming color variables: http://davidwalsh.name/sass-color-variables-dont-suck 
*
* - For Media queries we use a mobile first approach. So by default the page is
*   designed for a 100% width layout. For bigger screen sizes we set breakpoints 
*   and make sure it looks good.
*
* - For desktop our main column with is 860px
*
* - For the main layout containers we use ID's instead of classes!
*
* - We animate certain layers with CSS3 transitions! Be careful what properties
*	to be allowed through transitions. Those have maybe unwanted side effects later
*	on, which are hard to trace.
*
* - Avoid using transition: all its exansive and can have a lot of side effects!
*
* - We include mixins always at the top of the class defintion
*   Example:
*		.some-component{
*			@include transition(width 1s);
*			@include position(absolute, 0 0 0 0);
*           width: 120px;
*						
*		}
